user-panel in chat.css is not optimal
the way database module sends data to websocket module, need to find out whats the best way to use structs
    DONE // in browser without cached disabled sometimes chat doesn't load
    DONE // token isn't renewed when user joins with token
    DONE // token isn't deleted when it expires
display and customise server and user picture and name
    DONE // make it so people can join and leave servers
    DONE // display users in servers
    DONE // check if username is too short or long
    DONE // check if password is too short or long
look for security hole in server invitation process
make it possible to set duration on server invitation
make it possible to set set server invitation one time use only
    DONE // writing goroutine does not tell to reading goroutine if it fails
    DONE // placeholder servers stopped working
    DONE // check if user is authorized to get channels/messages from a server
    DONE // make sure client cant send messages to channels where they are not authorized
    DONE // make sure client cant request chat history of channel where they are not authorized
when new user joins a server, for others he wont show up in real time unless refreshed, because its http request only
serverMember.go line 70 is not optimal
    DONE // make it possible for user to customise profile pic
    DONE // require some kind of websocket session id to upload profile pic and attachments
limit filesize when user sends file
add more stuff to userChanges.go
    CANT // adding chat message should be a multi transaction
check if user can send message to server or request messages from server they are not in
cache joined servers too next to database
    DONE // check if username is already taken
    DONE // make attachment token expire after a time
    DONE // fix userdata updating, separating broadcast and reply
when switching channel or server, ignore all packages from previous one
add check if user is blocked when adding friends
    DONE // check for safe way to access wsClients when broadcasting
make expired cookie token deletion more efficient, so they are deleted in 1 query
when sending non supported attachment file, keep original filename
check what happens when non server owner tries to update picture/name of a server they don't own
